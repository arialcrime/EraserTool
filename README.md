When active, “EraserTool” turns curves into straight segments after you click on them. This might be helpful to get rid of all kinds of arbitrary curves.

Parts of the code is inspired by [ConvertToLines](https://github.com/BlackFoundry/ConvertToLines) by [BlackFoundry](https://github.com/BlackFoundry).
